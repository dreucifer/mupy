    ### Need help on Choosing the Right CS144 type Alternator? __*CALL 616-606-5045*__

    The difference between the dual and single rectifier alternators. Single rectifier is less reliable and cannot produce as much, but it is also cheaper and can fit in more applications. Dual rectifier has higher output and reliability, but is more expensive and takes up more room, limiting applications. The single rectifier may be given more reliability with the addition of a quicktifier remote rectifier system. There are also three common mounting styles the GM commonly uses a 2 foot 2 inch mount, some use the 6-12 mount, and '96-'01 3.8 liter v6 using the CS-130D type alternator use a third stretched foot mount shown below.
section3.md: |
    ## Upgrade to the larger CS-144 series alternator. The CS-144 produces more power at idle and is much more reliable  

    For Custom Applications we can install many different pulley types, like Single &amp; Dual V-Belt, 8-Groove etc.

    ## Delco Remy CS144 type Dual Rectifier High Output Alternator

    The rectifier is the most common cause of alternator failure. It's the only choice for super heavy duty operation. If you are using your alternator to it's extreme, you must have this alterantor! Alternators produce AC current, just like the current from your house wall outlet. Then it uses a bridge rectifier, typically with 6 diodes, to convert the AC current to DC for the battery and vehicles electrical system.
    
section5.md: |
    With Dual Rectifiers, you get 12 Diodes, which spreads the current load over a much larger area making the alternator twice as durable and twice as efficient at converting the AC current it makes to DC. The many benefits include:

    * Less heat build up
    * Less current loss
    * Higher amperage output when hot
    * More power at idle
        
    Plus, the service duty and life increases substantially. When the rectifier heats up the diodes won't pass as much amperage through them, therefore, the amperage output drops. With our double rectifier alternator you have twice the amperage carrying capacity and double the cooling surface area to keep the diodes cool. This all adds up to... more power, fewer heat problems and greater reliability.

    CS144 series Extreme Duty dual rectifier alternators. The best alternator for your high draw situation. Eight years of proven service and reliability in the field.

    ### Quicktifier Dual Remote Rectifier System 

    The Quicktifier Dual and Triple Rectifier Alternator Upgrade Kit allows you to take any existing alternator and make it an extreme duty dual or triple rectifier alternator. If you simply don't have room for our Extreme Duty Dual Rectifier CS144 alternator, add the Quicktifier 210 Dual or 420 Triple Rectifier Conversion kit. Run the three AC lines from the CS144 stator leads to the three studs on the Quicktifier's bridge rectifier. Then connect the Quicktifier and your alternator together in parallel. You now have Quicktifier Dual or Triple Rectifier durability on your existing alternator.
